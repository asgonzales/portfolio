            <p>Hi, my name is Sebastian Gonzales and I'm from Argentina - Buenos Aires.</p>
            <p>I'm 22 years old and I started and change university careers 3 times only to realize that I want to be a programmer. That is the second thing that I love, the first are cats.</p>
            <p>Now I have a Full Stack Developer title and I'm looking to work on this and more.</p>
            <p>So I made this portfolio to show all the projects I'll be working on.</p>
            <p>Feel free to leave a message, and thank you for visiting!</p>
